# Indoor-Scene-Recognition-Pytorch

Scene classification

Scene recognition is one of the high-level challenges in the image field, that's why in this project, your task is to create a baseline using
Image processing techniques and deep networks.
You should use 20% of the available data for the validation set, and it is suggested that you code your baseline using pytorch and the GoogleColab environment.
